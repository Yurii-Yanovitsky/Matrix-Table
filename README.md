# Frontend React Test Task Project

This project is a test task implementation of a matrix table using React. The table allows users to interact with the matrix by clicking on cells to increment their values, finding the nearest values by hovering over cells, and adding or removing rows. It also includes features for calculating and displaying row sums, column average.
